# Reverse-of-digits
Reverse of digits

Program Explanation:

1} User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.

2} The for loop is used and the last digit of the number is obtained by using the modulus operator.

3} The last digit is then stored at the one’s place, second last at the ten’s place and so on.

4} The last digit is then removed by truly dividing the number with 10.

5} This loop terminates when the value of the number is 0.

6} The reverse of the number is then printed.

Example 1:

Enter a number:548

Reverse of digits= 845

Example 2:

Enter a number:987

Reverse of digits= 789

Example 3:

Enter a number:739

Reverse of digits= 937
